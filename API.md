# API routes

The konfetti-backend exposes a JSON2-compliant HTTP api at port 3000.

* Where additinal body parameters are supported, the parameters have to be as utf8-encoded json. Expect all body parameters as optional.

* Upon successful creation or update, all routes return the new/changed instance(s)  in the { data: XXX } field.

Expect results to be have this form:
```
{
    "code": 200, // HTTP status (same as HTTP response code)
    "status": "success", // verbose response status
    "data": { // holds results, 
        "neighbourhoods": [] // results are generally retuned as an array of objects (same as models); if single objects are requested, this might also be a single object
    }
}
```

Expect errors to be retuned like this:
```
{
    "code": 500, // HTTP status (same as HTTP response code)
    "status": "error", // verbose response status
    "errors": [ // always returns an array of errors
        {
            "type": "mongodb", // type (optional)
            "message": "E11000 duplicate key error collection: konfetti.codes index: token_1 dup key: { : \"123\" }" // message (optional)
        }
    ]
}
```

## Usage and authentication

* Authentication is based on JWT for both rest and socket.io. If you receive an http 403, you have to require a new token first.
* To receive a new JWT, authenticate via basic auth against: 
```
/api/authenticate
```
* Once you hold a valid JWT, supply it in the HTTP header in the following form for subsecuent requests:
```
Key: Authorization, Value: Bearer <Token>
```
* Examples are provided in /stuff/ as a Postman-collection containing example requests for adding the first user (not documented here) and for acquireing tokens and sample requests.
* For development, there is an JWT in /stuff/ which does not expire.
